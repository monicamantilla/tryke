# tryke

Tryke is a social app geared at finding new people to attend events with or tag along on already existing events, made by users in a community.
The community is all from your immediate location (zip code), users will make a post with information such as how large their current party
is, where they are going (public place), and what the event is going to be. These posts will act as a forum to keep your community socializing with each other,
and also eliminating the dreaded third wheel.
